    <p align="left"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" target="_blank">Stanley Kubrick's</a> take on the Vietnam War follows smart-aleck Private Davis (Matthew Modine), 
        quickly christened "Joker" by his foul-mouthed drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey), and pudgy Private Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), 
        nicknamed "Gomer Pyle," as they endure the rigors of basic training. Though Pyle takes a frightening detour, 
        Joker graduates to the Marine Corps and is sent to Vietnam as a journalist, covering -- and eventually participating in -- the bloody Battle of Hué.</p>

    <p align="left">The loss of the individual, only for the individual to regain a sense of self through violence is a concept best 
        exemplified through both the establishing and concluding shots of the film and the character arcs of both 
        Private Leonard and Private “Joker.”  Throughout the film, Full Metal Jacket is littered with visual cues that in being
        in the army, the men who join are neither special nor unique.  Rather than beginning his film focusing on or 
        introducing his protagonist to his audience, Kubrick instead focuses on the nameless and faceless and the abuse they 
        suffer.  As the film begins with a series of close-up shots of various young men’s faces as their heads are 
        unceremoniously shaved, the camera does not linger on their apathetic faces.  Not only do these young men say nothing, 
        they are also all framed in the same way, leading to a conveyor belt of people who seem inconsequential as the sequence
        comes to an abrupt end, focusing not on a singular young man, but on the large amount of hair which has fallen to the
        ground.  This sentiment is mirrored again in the following sequence, where Gunnery Sergeant Hartman walks down the
        line of young men dressed in uniform and standing in front of their bunks.  All of the men are dressed in the same
        dull green, they all stand the exact same, and their perfectly made beds are all dressed in the same dull green
        that matches their uniforms.  As Sergeant Hartman walks past the young men, berating them, again, Kubrick’s camera
        work asserts that none of them are unique, as the camera tracks Hartman’s movements in a medium tracking shot.  
        Rather than appear as people, they look like toys in a factory.  As Hartman walks past these men, he tells them 
        “If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training, you will be a weapon, you will be a minister of 
        death, praying for war. . . But until that day,. . . you’re not even human fucking beings.”  In those rare cases 
        when Hartman does stop to berate a particular young man, the gift of individuation he gives them is singling them 
        out and creating for them a unique tirade of insults.</p>
    <br>

    <br>

    <p align="left">In this sequence, Private Leonard stands out as an individual because, as opposed to all of the other 
        young men, who respond to Hartman’s screams with a cold, yet fearful expression, he smiles, and cannot stop until 
        Hartman demands that Leonard lean forward and choke himself on his hand.  In this moment, Leonard becomes 
        individuated from the mass in that he is unable to behave like the other men, something which is asserted by his 
        extreme difficulty in mastering the obstacle course and “Joker”’s having to father him, even buttoning his shirt 
        later in the film.</p>

    <br>
    <p align="left">While eventually Leonard begins to survive recruit training like the rest of his peers, 
        thereby submitting to his deindividuation, he once again relapses into being unable to perform like everyone else.  
        At approximately the 27 minute mark of the film, Kubrick pans slowly left in a medium-long shot over the recruits 
        performing grueling exercise as Hartman stands over them.  As the camera watches the recruits operate as one mass, 
        it finally stops and lingers on Leonard, sitting down above them, his thumb in his mouth as part of Hartman’s 
        punishment for his inability to perform, thereby encouraging the trained mass to turn against him.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="img/fmj_5.jpeg" alt="NO IMAGE" height="540" width="960" class="center">
    <br>
    <p align="left">In the following scene, when Leonard is tied down to his bed by “Cowboy” so that the other recruits can 
        beat him with clubs made from bars of soap and pillow cases, “Joker” does nothing.  As he watches, he is provided 
        an opportunity: either he can join in with the mass or he can choose for himself to not participate or to help 
        Leonard.  Instead, Kubrick subverts the idea that not being part of the mass means that one will be act as a good 
        person: “Joker” chooses to also beat Leonard, though he does so alone and beats him more savagely than the rest.</p>

    <br>
    <p align="left">Something crucial to consider in this film, as it is in any film, is the role of women.  
        What I find so fascinating about this film is that women are constantly present, even if they are not on screen; 
        for this reason, I find it notable that "Joker" at the end kills a young girl.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="img/fmj_7.jpeg" alt="NO IMAGE" height="540" width="960" class="center">
    <br>
    <p align="left">In this film, Kubrick explores the conundrum of the cultural male phenomenon of having simultaneously 
        derision toward women and being sexually attracted to them.  Something which I believe best exemplifies this are 
        the vulgar and misogynistic chants Hartman has the recruits sing as they run: "Mama and Papa were laying in bed / 
        Mama rolled over this is what she said / A gimmie some. . . / Good for you /  Good for me / Mmm good," 
        "I don't know what I been told / Eskimo pussy is mighty cold / Mmm good / Feels good / is good / real good / tastes 
        good / mighty good / good for you / good for me."  Furthermore, earlier in the film, one of Hartman's insults to 
        one of the recruits is that "It looks to me like the best part of you ran down the crack of your mama's ass and 
        ended up as a brown stain on the mattress."  Despite objectifying and demeaning women throughout the film, Hartman 
        has a deep and disturbing reverence for the Virgin Mary.  The first time a woman is seen in the film, she is a 
        Vietnamese prostitute trying to engage in a transaction with "Joker" and his friend.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="img/fmj_8.jpeg" alt="NO IMAGE" height="540" width="960" class="center">
    <br>
    <p align="left">These moments taken into consideration with the fact that the film concludes with a young girl being tortured and 
        eventually killed, surrounded by men who decide her fate, makes me think about how women are presented in the film.  
        For this reason, I do not believe that Kubrick intended for any of Hartman's barbs to be taken in jest, even though there 
        are multiple articles and YouTube videos compiling his insults.  There is a peculiar nature to how women are revered, hated,
        ignored, and disregarded within the film's narrative which I argue leads me to wonder why is it that most find it funny to 
        call a man a "lady" as an insult, why is it that women are portrayed in this manner in the film, why is it that there is a 
        dichotomous way that women are discussed in the film, and what does it mean that the film ends with a young girl's life 
        being taken away from her, before she could become a woman?</p>
    <br>
    <img src="img/fmj_9.jpeg" alt="NO IMAGE" height="540" width="960" class="center">
    <br>
    <p align="left">Another way to view this film is through the lens of it being simultaneously a story about war but also, 
        and what I argue most importantly, about the human condition.</p>
    <br>
    <p align="left">Many, if not all, of the events which happen in the film could be transferred to Kubrick's audience.  
        Specifically, in the relationship between "Joker" and Leonard is one situation which I believe is most applicable 
        outside of an army setting, as it calls to question loyalty and how men express same-sex relationships.  
        Something that I considered is that scene where "Joker" takes part in the beating of Leonard; prior to this moment, 
        Leonard and "Joker" share many intimate sequences together after Hartman told "Joker" that Leonard was his responsibility.  
        For instance, I urge you to consider those scenes where "Joker" teaches Leonard how to clean his gun, "Joker" coaches and 
        encourages Leonard in the obstacle course, and especially that sequence where "Joker" buttons Leonard's shirt.  
        Because of these intimate moments, I believe Kubrick postulates what a homosexual, male relationship would appear 
        to be in the army, if it could even exist at that point in time without ostracisation.  
        Therefore, these moments taken into consideration at that point in the film where "Cowboy," holding Leonard down, 
        tells "Joker" to take part in harming Leonard, can lead to a different interpretation of the relationship between the two 
        young men and the film, wherein "Joker"'s sexuality and manhood is questioned by his fellow recruits.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="img/fmj_10.jpeg" alt="NO IMAGE" height="540" width="960" class="center">
    <br>
    <p align="left">Considering this, I believe it is extremely fitting that Leonard's final moments are spent intimately in a 
        room that is normally considered by society to be a private place with "Joker."  When Hartman enters the room, he is 
        eliminated not only because Leonard has gone mad, but also because he does not belong there: what is being directly 
        confronted in a subtle manner is the relationship between "Joker" and Leonard and what it meant to them and the overall 
        narrative of the film.</p>
    <br>
    <p align="left">When Leonard says, "I am in a world of shit," I believe that the world can be interpreted as not only a 
        world in which wars take place, but also a world in which young men do not feel comfortable expressing homosexual 
        relationships and feelings.  In this way, just as with Hartman's barbs, Leonard feels personally attacked, as if he is 
        in a world of shit from which he cannot escape without taking himself out of it.</p>
    <br>
    <p align="left">Therefore, when "Joker" ends the film in a voice over, insisting, "I am in a world of shit, yes.  
        But I am alive.  And I am not afraid,” I believe this is extremely significant.</p>
    <br>
    <p align="left">These final words hold an overwhelming amount of power in the overarching narrative of the film.  
        The most obvious point is that "Joker" re-uses, re-appropriates, and re-considers Leonard's final words to him, 
        that he is in a world of shit.  What I find most interesting, though, is how this sequence is framed in conjunction 
        to what "Joker" is saying.</p>
    <br>
    <p align="left">As "Joker" says that he is not afraid of the world, I believe it is notable that he is walking through the 
        flames of a ruined town, surrounded by a hoard of soldiers.  Taking this into consideration, I believe Kubrick asks of 
        his audience, does it really matter that "Joker" is not afraid of the world?  Who would be in his scenario?  
        Furthermore, I believe that it is important to note that although "Joker" is not afraid of the world, 
        the rest of the world may be afraid of him, considering the devastation he has caused in the sequence over which he 
        speaks and also considering the general atrocities of war, something that would make it extremely difficult, 
        if not impossible, to relate to his friends and family once he returns from war.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="img/fmj_11.jpeg" alt="NO IMAGE" height="540" width="960" class="center">
    <br>
    <p aling="left">While at the beginning of the film, "Joker" and the rest of the recruits of the film were afraid of going 
        into war and took Hartman's insults with clenched bodies and fear in their eyes, these are not the same people they are 
        by the end of the film.  At the film's conclusion, they have parted ways never to see each other again, are dead, or 
        share the burden of being, as Hartman wanted to create in them, machines of war.</p>
    <br>
    <p aling="left">At the conclusion of their individual story arcs, Kubrick allows for Leonard to determine a sense of self 
        through the killing of Hartman and the killing of himself and allows for “Joker” to become an individual through 
        choosing to shoot the young sniper girl out of mercy.  Both conclusions to these young men’s stories leave an incredibly
        dark aftertaste as the thesis of the film is made clear, with medium-long shots of soldiers chanting the 
        “Mickey Mouse March” as they walk through the flames of a ruined town.  Although the film ends with “Joker” assertively
        stating and mirroring the words of the comrade he helped torture, “I am so happy that I am alive, in one piece.  
        In short, I am in a world of shit, yes, but I am alive, and I am not afraid,” in the context of this film and its 
        narrative, his words are meaningless.  In a film which studies intensely “the adaptation of the individual to the 
        demands of a ritualistic male group,” the futile musings of a young man attempting to make sense of what he has done 
        and the life he leads mean nothing as he marches on the earth he and his peers have scorched (White 205).</p>
