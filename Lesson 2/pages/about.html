        <h2>History of pizza</h2>
        <p>
            Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age. Records of people adding other ingredients to
            bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian
            soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates
            on top of their battle shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese.
            An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells
            that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In
            Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with
            cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.
            The first mention of the word "pizza" comes from a notarial document written in Latin and dating to May 997
            AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day,
            and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day."

            Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th
            century.Before
            that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is
            uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims.Until about 1830, pizza was
            sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries.

            A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when
            the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to
            create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the
            Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag â€” red (tomato), green (basil),
            and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, although later
            research cast doubt on this legend. An official letter of recognition from the Queen's "head of service"
            remains on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.

            Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first
            appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City
            in 1905. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to
            Italy's native cuisine, proved a ready market for pizza in particular.

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been developed to overcome
            challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be
            frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising
            crusts.

            Another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then
            sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce
            and basic ingredients, to assemble at home before baking in an oven.

        <h3>Baking</h3>
        <p>In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven,
            a conveyor belt oven, or, in traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. The pizza is slid into
            the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on hot bricks, a screen (a round metal grate,
            typically aluminum), or whatever the oven surface is. Before use, a peel is typically sprinkled with
            cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily slide on and off it. When made at home, a pizza can be baked on a
            pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce some of the heating effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on a
            metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it. Some home chefs use a
            wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. As in restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza
            ovens have been for centuries, in order to achieve even heat distribution. Another variation is grilled
            pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like deep dish Chicago and
            Sicilian style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Most restaurants use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables to assemble their pizzas. Mass
            production of pizza by chains can be completely automated.
